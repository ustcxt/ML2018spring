Requirements:
	train at least two defferent DNN models with the same amount of parameters until convergence
	compare the training process of models by showing the loss in each epoch in a chart
	visualize the ground-truth and predictions by models in a graph
Tips:
	constrain the input domain
	hyper-parameters are important(i.e.tune all models to the best)
