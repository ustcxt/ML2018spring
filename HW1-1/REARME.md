# Simulate a Function 
## Requirements:
<big>
* train at least two defferent DNN models with the same amount of parameters until convergence.<br>
* compare the training process of models by showing the loss in each epoch in a chart
	visualize the ground-truth and predictions by models in a graph
## Tips:
* constrain the input domain
	hyper-parameters are important(i.e.tune all models to the best)<br>

#### Results:
**simulate function:**
$$\frac{\sin(5\pi x)}{5\pi x}$$

# Train on Actual Tasks
## Requirements:
- use MNIST or CIFAR-10
- use CNN or DNN
- visualize the training process by showing both loss and accuracy on two charts
## Tips:
- CNN is easier to see the difference
